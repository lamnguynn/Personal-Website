                                From my about page I talked about how I like shoes and being outdoors. Well those two things motivated me to do tech, primarily mobile applications. And you can probably tell, these two hobbies involve a lot of planning. While there are many solutions to planning and organizing whatever, I believe there is never one solution and I rather have the freedom to do things and experiment by myself. This reason and I need something fast and light is why I chose mobile applications, particularly iOS. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I love development with C++/C and Python because they have interesting problems, but Apple provides a great ecosystem and I can build something that will directly increase quality of life for myself and others. Which is also why I enjoyed web development in HTML/CSS/Javascript.

                                But broadly speaking, I love coding because just like the two hobbies I like to do, coding is full of small details and I am motivated to continue because I want to learn about different ways to add small details to a project, and I always learn something new each time I code.
