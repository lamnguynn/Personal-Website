                            All Keys is a password manager that allows users to store their credentials securely and utilize them using auto fill. My motivation for making this app was to provide myself and others with a simple and accessible way to store their passwords without having to pay or use the Notes app. I definitely felt this project solidified my knowledge in Swift and built my confidence more as most of the features I had implemented were new and had to be done perfectly to ensure trust from users, and avoid a lawsuit.

                            From building my apps, I have been able to publish two Cocoapods as a side project: a HalfModalViewController and DropDownButton. My motivation for doing so is that Apple does not provide any options for either to enhance the user experience, so I decided to build my own. Doing so was quite challenging as I had to really break down how each framework would work fundamentally and piece it together. I also learned Git and worked extensively with Unix Terminal to clean and upload these dependencies.

                            All Fit is a fitness planning app that allows users to build their workouts with pre-added exercises or they can add their own, and it is the first app I published. My motivation for building this app was that I was tired of using the Notes app to plan my workouts and wanted to create something more clean and apply my recent Swift knowledge. Building this project was definitely a challenge as I had a couple weeks of experience in basic Swift and had no experience with App Store Connect. But overall I used this project as a chance to explore Appleâ€™s frameworks and publishing process, as well as Xcode.

                            All Planned is a weekly planning app I designed for HowdyHack 2021 that allows users to plan and save whatever tasks they have for the week. Following the release of All Fit, I used this app to build some soft skills like planning and organization, as well as working with new features such as Dates and Times and UNUserNotificationCenter frameworks from Apple.
